Hello and welcome.

The Last video was just a begninning of transport layer and was an introduction.

but, now it's time to write the two programs client.go and sever.go

These two prograns will give us a taste of process to process communication

and along with that they will be fun to write.

You can find these programs links in the resources and you can just copy paste them into

any go file and and run them as a go application.

In this video I am going to explain each of the program line by line and 

once we are done with our programs we will run them and see process to process communication in action.

So let's start with our server.go
