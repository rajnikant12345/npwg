This video is about introduction to transport layer,
i.e. also called as layer 4 of the OSI model.

To know more about Layer 2 and layer 3 , try my udemy course , Go Network programming part 1,
The link to that course can be found in resources.

This course is all about layer 4 and beyond and
do not cover machine to machine communication or host to host communication

In this section we will cover why we need transport layer,
what are it's roles and responsibilities and
how it functions to fulfill those responsibilities.

Before we proceed, it's good to have knowledge about following topics.

How data is delivered from one host to another host ?
How IP address and physical address of machines are related to each other ?
Why and how of data link layer and network layer.

The above topics are not compulsory, but they are good to know.


Now let's begin with our first question ?

Why do we need this transport layer ?

The answer to this question is ,

Communication on the Internet is not defined as the exchange of data between two nodes or between two hosts.
Real communication takes place between two processes.


Now the question is, what is a process ?

For those who don't know what a process is,

Any running application on our system is a process, e.g. web browser application, calculator application etc.

But do you know sometimes, we need two processes to communicate to each other.

For doing that we need a standard way

and transport layer or layer 4 defines that standard.

Web surfing is the best example of process to process communication,

in that our web browser process is communicating to a web server , serving the website that we are visiting.

For two processes to communicate we have certain prerequisites ,

let's talk about them

Number  1 is really obvious, they must know each other's address.
Number 2 is they must understand each other.
and lastly
There must be an open channel of communication between them.

So , now for starters we will write two go programs that will demonstrate process to process communication.

Then we will go into more details of what transport layer has to offer.


So, let's move on to our coding video.

See you there
